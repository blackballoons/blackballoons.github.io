Like an unfaithful disciple, I come back to writing again and again asking for some sort of salvation. And there is something to that. 1st, that I repeatedly need or want salvation and 2nd, whatever happened before I think writing is IT.
It could very well be that I haven't learn anything or it could be that I'm hopeful. But at any case, here I am again.
