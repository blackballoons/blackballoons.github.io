The word 약 (pronounced Yak) in the phrase 강**약**조절 is a homonym meaning either medication or weak. It's one of many Korean words with roots in Chinese (the traditional Chinese letter is 藥, pronounced yào in Chinese). And I'm guessing the bike maker was trying to say Weak instead of Drug; but Google translate pulled a fast one on them. But let me make things not funny by pointing out the better translation isn't *strong weak control* in the first place. Difficulty or Level can better indicate Easy to Difficult. Because that's how translation works.
